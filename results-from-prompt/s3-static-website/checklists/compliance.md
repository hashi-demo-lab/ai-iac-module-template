# Compliance Checklist: S3 Static Website Hosting Module

**Purpose**: Validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of compliance-related requirements including tagging, input validation, module structure, testing standards, and organizational governance.
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [specs/s3-static-website/spec.md](/workspace/specs/s3-static-website/spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `checklist generation` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Does FR-003 specify the exact tag key names and casing (e.g., "Environment" vs "environment") for mandatory tags? [Completeness, Spec: Bucket Creation and Core Configuration]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are requirements defined for tag value validation (e.g., max length, allowed characters) beyond the non-empty constraint for owner and cost_center? [Gap]
- [x] CHK003 - Does FR-021 specify the complete set of S3 bucket naming rules to validate (lowercase, no underscores, 3-63 chars, no IP format, no trailing dashes), or is the list partial? [Completeness, Spec: Input Validation] — Resolved: FR-021 updated with comprehensive naming rules from AWS docs.
- [x] CHK004 - Are requirements specified for a Terraform required_providers block with minimum version constraints in versions.tf? [Gap, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements] — Resolved: NFR-006 specifies AWS provider >= 5.0.0 and Terraform >= 1.3.0.
- [ ] CHK005 - Does NFR-004 enumerate the specific test scenarios required, or is "covering default creation, full-featured creation, feature toggles, and input validation" specific enough to be verifiable? [Completeness, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK006 - Does FR-022 specify whether the allowed environment values (dev, staging, prod) are case-sensitive, and whether this list is extensible by the consumer? [Completeness, Spec: Input Validation]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 - Is FR-004 ("mandatory tags MUST take precedence") clear about the implementation mechanism (merge order in locals vs. explicit override logic)? [Clarity, Spec: Bucket Creation and Core Configuration]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is FR-023 ("non-empty strings") specific enough for owner and cost_center, or should the spec define minimum length, format guidance, or example values? [Clarity, Spec: Input Validation]
- [ ] CHK009 - Does NFR-005 ("clear enough for terraform-docs to generate useful documentation") define what "useful" means, or is this subjective? [Clarity, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is SC-010 ("clear, actionable error messages") specific enough, or should the spec provide example error message formats or content requirements? [Clarity, Spec: Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK011 - Does the spec clarify whether "every resource it creates" in FR-003 includes only the bucket or also all sub-resources (encryption config, versioning, lifecycle, etc.)? [Clarity, Spec: Bucket Creation and Core Configuration]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 - Is the Module Interface Summary list of 13 input variables complete and consistent with all variables referenced across User Stories, Functional Requirements, and Edge Cases? [Consistency, Spec: Module Interface Summary]
- [ ] CHK013 - Is User Story 5 Scenario 3 ("mandatory tag value takes precedence") consistent with FR-004 in describing the same behavior, and do both specify the same tag keys? [Consistency, Spec: User Story 5 / Bucket Creation and Core Configuration]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are the required variables listed in User Story 1 ("bucket_name, environment, owner, cost_center") consistent with the variable definitions having no defaults (making them truly required)? [Consistency, Spec: User Story 1 / Module Interface Summary]
- [ ] CHK015 - Is the "Invalid owner format" edge case ("no overly strict validation on format, but it must be non-empty") consistent with FR-023 ("non-empty strings"), and is the explicit decision to not validate format documented as intentional? [Consistency, Spec: Edge Cases / Input Validation]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 - Can SC-001 ("terraform validate passes") be run independently without provider credentials, and is this constraint documented? [Measurability, Spec: Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK017 - Does SC-002 specify the minimum number of test cases or scenarios, or is "at minimum" sufficient to be verifiable? [Measurability, Spec: Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK018 - Can SC-006 ("README.md includes all input variables, all output values, and at least one usage example") be objectively verified via automation? [Measurability, Spec: Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK019 - Does SC-004 ("demonstrate clearly distinct use cases") define measurable criteria for what makes the basic and complete examples "clearly distinct"? [Measurability, Spec: Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 - Does the spec cover the scenario where a consumer adds new custom tags on a subsequent apply to an existing bucket? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 - Are requirements defined for what happens when a mandatory tag key name changes in a future module version (migration/upgrade path)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 - Does the spec address the pre-commit validation pipeline scenario and what specific checks must pass before code is committed? [Coverage, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK023 - Are requirements specified for module versioning and backward compatibility of the variable interface? [Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK024 - Does the spec define behavior when the `tags` input map contains a very large number of tags (approaching AWS limits of 50 tags per resource)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 - Is the edge case of an empty string for `bucket_name` (vs. null/not-provided) explicitly handled in the validation requirements? [Coverage, Spec: Edge Cases / Input Validation]
- [ ] CHK026 - Does the spec define what error message format validation rejections should follow (e.g., include the invalid value, suggest valid alternatives)? [Coverage, Spec: Input Validation]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK027 - Does the spec define performance expectations for the module (e.g., maximum plan time, resource count limits)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are documentation requirements specified beyond NFR-005 (variable descriptions), such as inline code comments, CHANGELOG, or architecture decision records? [Gap, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK029 - Does NFR-003 specify the minimum content required in each example directory (e.g., main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, terraform.tfvars.example)? [Completeness, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK030 - Does NFR-001 specify requirements for a versions.tf file content (required_version constraint, required_providers block)? [Completeness, Spec: Non-Functional Requirements] — Resolved: NFR-006 specifies minimum versions.
